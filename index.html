            <h3>MY STORY</h3>
            <p>My name is Tiago. I am in my late 20s and I’m originally from Lisbon, although I’m currently living in Slovenia. I work for Renaissance Periodization (RP) and I have my own coaching business where I help people with their training and fitness goals.

                <br><br>I’ve always been somewhat of a nerd, so when I started my fitness journey almost 10 years ago, that led me to learn everything I could about it. I was obsessed with it, learning about training and nutrition every single day. I initially started with Youtube videos, but soon started to read books and blogs. Eventually, that progressed to textbooks, scientific articles, and several courses and certifications.  
                
                <br><br>I got particularly interested in exercise and nutritional science and making sure my methods were evidence-based rather than just following traditional unproven practices. Especially since like many others, I ended up following poor advice and making me spin my wheels. There is nothing more frustrating than putting in hours of work trying to achieve your goal but not making any progress. The more I learned the better I was able to improve my own results. I want to help you avoid misinformation and get to your goal in the most efficient manner possible.

                    KNOW ABOUT MY COACHING SERVICES?</h4>
                <div id="s-text">
                    <h6>‣You have to be willing to work hard</h6>
                        <p>I can help you reach your goals, but you’re the one doing the work. I can not train or diet for you.</p>

                    <h6>‣Results take time </h6>
                    <p>I wish I could say I will get you super big, strong, or lean in a few weeks, but that just doesn’t happen. I don’t promise quick results, and everyone who does is being deceitful. This doesn’t mean you won’t get to your goals, but just be mindful it requires work and time.</p>

                    <h6>‣I always have sustainability in mind</h6>
                    <p>I will never compromise long-term results for faster short-term progress.</p>

                    <h6>‣I’m not a motivational coach</h6>
                    <p>The best way of thinking about our coach-client relationship is that I’m guiding you, but I can’t motivate you to train or diet. You have to have the willpower to reach your goals, and with my experience and knowledge, I will help to reach them in the easiest, safest and most effective way possible.</p>
